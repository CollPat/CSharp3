# HTTPS

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol **S**ecure) is an **encrypted version of the HTTP protocol**. It uses [TLS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) to encrypt all communication between a client and a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server, such as when performing banking activities or online shopping.
