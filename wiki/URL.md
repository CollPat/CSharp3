# URL

Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a text string that specifies where a resource (such as a web page, image, or video) can be found on the Internet.

In the context of HTTP, URLs are called "Web address" or "link". Your browser displays URLs in its address bar, for example: <https://developer.mozilla.org> Some browsers display only the part of a URL after the "//", that is, the Domain name.
